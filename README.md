* Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app. *

As a vegan who loves luxury handbags, I and many others struggle with our morals and ethics towards purchasing these items as they are made from animal products. I aim to create a trustworthy application that facilitates the listing and purchasing of authentic pre-loved luxury handbags.

### R8 ###
* Why is it a problem that needs solving? *

As more people are trying to be more conscious about their buying choices, there needs to be a platform that can facilitate and encourage this. I hope to build a trustworthy platform that can encourage ethical buying.
